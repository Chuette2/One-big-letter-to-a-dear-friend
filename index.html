</p>
  <p>It’s been a long journey to get to where you are now, and to think that you still have such a long way ahead of you– ahead of us all, it's crazy to think about. When I think about you, and how your soul is molded, the first thing that comes to mind is how sweet of a person you are, sometimes you're <i>too</i> sweet of a person. A part of me wishes that the world could be kinder to you, the people you meet– the people who made you that way– should have been more thoughtful before subjecting you to such a world.
</p>

  <p>The second thing that comes to mind is your willpower. When you decide to set your mind to something, you will stick with it until the end. It’s that stubbornness that sometimes leads us– the oldest child, into some trouble. I’m sure it's that same willpower, as well as the intent to do good- that forces us to make stupid decisions sometimes. You have a pure heart, it was never meant to be manipulated into something bad by someone else.
</p>

  <p>The third thing that comes to mind is the amount of patience you have. Whether it be through your natural awkwardness, or simply being a gentle soul who harbors a lot of time, it's admirable. You’ve put up with so much stuff throughout your entire life. From me flaming you, to the insane relationships that you’ve endured, and the burden that is being the oldest. I can see it all manifest in who you are today, in the greatest ways possible.
</p>

  <p>Eight-teen years, huh? I wonder how that feels. I wonder if you’ll drown in the responsibilities of an adult, paying bills with paycheck by paycheck, having to cook and go to the doctor’s office by yourself, or maybe you’ll keep being a kid, speeding down that road at 90 miles per hour, feeling as immortal as ever. Maybe you’ll get stuck somewhere in-between, not quite an adult, but not young enough to be a kid again. 
</p>

  <p>Wherever you end up after this, just know that you’ll always have us, or atleast, me. I really do look forward to that old stupid dream of living all together in a big fucking mansion, doing stupid shit, with the best of friends I could have ever dreamed of having.
</p>

  <p>We really gotta party some day, all of us all together. Drinks will be passed around as we reminisce on times that we were stupid kids. We’ll talk about all the stuff from our teenage years. How so and so, did this and that, and what not. Man do I live for times like that.
</p>

  <p>Athena, a name that means war, wisdom, strength, and protection, and I see ways where you embody all of that. If not now, at least someday. I believe that one day you’ll grow to have a beautiful soul, if you don’t already have one. Most of all, I can’t wait to be one of the few people to see that journey of growth, from your lowest moments to your highest.
